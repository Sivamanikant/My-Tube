# 🎥 YouTube-Clone (Not Just Another Clone)

This is not your regular YouTube clone. Built as a part of my React JS learning journey, this project implements **advanced features** that go beyond static UI replication.

It **fetches real-time data from the YouTube API** and mimics several **industry-level functionalities** with performance-optimized coding practices like **debouncing**, **API polling**, and **nested components**.
